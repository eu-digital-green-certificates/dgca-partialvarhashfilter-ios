# DGCPartialVarHashFilter

This repository contains the iOS implementation of a partial variable hash filter used in the context of the EU Digital Corona Certificate for use in the verifier and wallet app. The partial variable hash filter can be implemented to take in hashes of revoked certificates so these may be stored in a slim and data friendly manner.
