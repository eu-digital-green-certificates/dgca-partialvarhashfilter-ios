# DGCPartialVarHashFilter

This repository contains the iOS implementation of a partial variable hash filter used in the context of the EU Digital Corona Certificate for use in the [verifier](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-verifier-app-ios) and [wallet](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-wallet-app-ios) app. The partial variable hash filter can be implemented to take in hashes of revoked certificates so these may be stored in a slim and data friendly manner.
